= Managing the sidebars to suit your layout =

Please note: the theme's homepage and "full-width" template pages do not display any sidebars, regardless of this custom setting.

By default, the Widgeon Advanced theme displays a sidebar on the right-hand side of most pages and posts.
However, you can optionally display a left-hand sidebar in addition to, or instead of, the right-hand sidebar;
and you can optionally remove both sidebars for a clean single-column layout.  
To change the sidebar display:

1. From your site's wp-admin interface, select Appearance > Theme Options
2. Select the "Advanced Settings" tab if it is not already selected
3. Under the "Sidebar Options" dropdown menu, select the sidebar option that best suits your website.

= Changing the maximum container width =

The default maximum container width is 1024 pixels for screens larger than 1024 pixels.  
You can increase this value to better utilize the display area available on large screens.
Alternatively, you can eliminate the container width setting, for a layout that fills 100% of all screen widths.

1. From your site's wp-admin interface, select Appearance > Theme Options
2. Select the "Advanced Settings" tab if it is not already selected
3. Type a number in the box. Do not enter units of measurement.  (This setting currently only accepts an integer.)
4. Click "Save Options."
5. Your website's container element's width has been set.
